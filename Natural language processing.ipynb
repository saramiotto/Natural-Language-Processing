    "### Description\n",
    "In this notebook, we ask you to complete four main tasks to show what you have learnt during the NLU labs. Therefore, to complete the assignment please refer to the concepts, libraries and other materials shown and used during the labs. The last task is not mandatory, it is a *BONUS* to get an extra mark for the laude. \n",

    "### Instructions\n",
    "- **Dataset**: in this notebook, you are asked to work with the dataset *Conll 2003* provided by us in the *data* folder. Please, load the files from the *data* folder and **do not** change names or paths of the inner files. \n",
    "- **Output**: for each part of your task, print your results and leave it in the notebook. Please, **do not** send a jupyter notebook without the printed outputs.\n",
    "- **Other**: follow carefully all the further instructions and suggestions given in the question descriptions.\n",
